# Abatab Roadmap Queue

## Core functionality

### **Integrate ScriptLinkStandard**

> COMPLETE: v23.2

Integrate ScriptLinkStandard into Abatab.

> TBD

### **Depreciate NTST.ScriptLink**

> TBD

Remove NTST.ScriptLink from Abatab.

### **Review all SessionDetails**

> TBD

We might not need all of them.

### **Change Documentation\ to XMLdoc\**

> TBD

Also move sourcecode.md somewhere.


### **Catch any missing RequestComponents**

> TBD

Might crash things, might want to set them to "undefined" to be safe.

### **Better session log name**

> TBD

Right now it's the date, should be time or date/time.

### Self-test

> TBD

Export some example OptionObjects as JSON, then use them to test?

### **Implment ScriptLinkStandard methods**

> TBD

Some cool stuff there.

### **Fix error code stuff on warning popups**

> TBD

There are some codes, mostly for troubleshooting, that are at the end of the warning popups.

These need to be modified to actually mean something.

### **Fix name of warning logs**

> TBD

Prob have additional info (e.g., dose diff) in name.

### **[VERIFY] All log types are written to the correct folder**

> TBD

See topic.

> TBD

Create a class:
* FieldIdNumber = <hardcode>
* FieldIdValue = ""
* FieldIdFound = false

Create a List<ThatClass> for all FieldIds

Pass that to a parse method that returns a List<ThatClass>:

* FieldIdNumber = <hardcode>
* FieldIdValue = "value"
* FieldIdFound = true

### **Roundhouse move**

> TBD

Maybe move Roundhouse out of the main stuff.

### **Combine "Core.AbatabLogging.BuidlPath.cs" and Core.AbatabLogging.BuildPaths.cs**

> TBD

Combine "Core.AbatabLogging.BuidlPath.cs" and Core.AbatabLogging.BuildPaths.cs

### **Rename "Core.AbatabLogging.BuidlPaths.BuildDir()" methods to "BuildPath()"**

> TBD

"Path" makes more sense than "Dir"

### **Update all BuildPaths.cs methods to return List**

> TBD

When [Warning logs were implemented](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Abatab/issues/90), changes were made to Core.AbatabLogging.BuildPaths.cs specific to the Warning logs.

We should modify the remaining methods in BuildPaths.cs to return `List<string>`

### **Move FieldId data to config file**

> TBD

Easier to change.

### **Log file delay**

> TBD

As functionality is added, more staff use Abatab, and more logfiles are written, we should probably look at the write delay and determine:

* What is the best global delay?
* Are there certain logs that should not have a delay?
* Are there certain logs that should always have a specific delay?

### **Add Abatab version to log files**

> TBD

Right now this is hardcoded.

### **Why are all OptObjects getting set to the finalOptObj?**

> TBD

Unknown.

### **Log efficiency**

> TBD

Make sure we aren't going through the logging motions, and not creating log files (e.g., debug logs).

This will probably involve logging detail levels.

### **Access log details**

> TBD

The access log should have a better, more descriptive filename and contents.

Logging detail levels

### **Trace logs just the filename**

> TBD

This was implmented in v23.2 via a quick fix, but we need to go through an properly make this work.

Maybe create a new trace log named TRACEMSG that can have content.

### **Logging detail levels**

> TBD

Logging detail levels

### **Error log functionality**

> TBD

When Abatab encounters an error, that error should be written to a separate error file.

The warning log should be written:

- [ ] To an external `Errors/` folder that is not accessible to the public

This functionality will require:

* TBD

### **Lost logs**

> TBD

Catch any logs that aren't one of the official types.

### **Source code cleanup/refactor**

> TBD

Cleanup

### **More permenant empty trace log content**

> TBD

See development notes [here](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Abatab/issues/110)

### **Verify Settings.settings order is consistant**

> TBD

There are various locations in the source code where the settings/configuration values are listed. We should make sure that each of those locations match.

This includes Web.config and Settings.settings.

### **Cleanup DocFX folders**

> TBD

Verify that DocFX has what it needs, and doesn't have unnecessary data.

## Module functionality

### **ModProgressNote: PlaceOfService-VerifyTelehealth tied to File Note**

> TBD

Currently tied to two other fields, can probably simplify/speed up things by tying to the File Note button.

### **ModCommon: Maybe remove?**

> TBD

Not sure if we need this, since most common functionality should go in Core.

> TBD

### **ModQuickMedOrder: Change ModQuickMedOrderDosePercentBoundary to "25"**

> TBD

Easier to read and modify, less prone to mistakes. Will need to be changed in Web.config, as well as source code.

### **ModQuickMedOrder: Log all ModQuickMedOrder details**

> TBD

Log all QMO data in session log (e.g., LastOrderScheduledText)  

Additional datapoints for troubleshooting

### **ModQuickMedOrder: Dose warnings**

> TBD

* Public name needs to be formatted better
* Public log data should be different
* Private name should include a timestamp
* Move session warning logs to root of the session (like the .session log is)

### **ModQuickMedOrder: Dose information to log**

> TBD

We should be writing a bunch of this stuff to logs, even when successful.

## Documentation

### **Complete Documentation**

> TBD

All documentation through v23.3 should be complete, including:

- [ ] XML documentation
- [ ] The Abatab Manual
- [ ] Abatab APIs

<!-- -->
***
<!-- -->

## Regression

### **[VERIFY] QuickMedOrder-Dose-VerifyAmount**

> TBD

Test the following:

- [ ] Dose.VerifyUnderMaxPercentIncrease
- [ ] Dose.VerifyUnderMaxMilligramIncrease
- [ ] Dose.VerifyUnderMaxPercentIncrease

Also make sure that the testing documentation is up to date.

Eventually we should make this a built-in test.

### **[VERIFY] AbatabOption**

> TBD

Verify that even though there is space for an AbatabOption in the Script Parameter, it doesn't affect anything if it's missing.

### **[VERIFY] All combinations of log file types work**

> TBD

For example: error-trace-warning, trace-warning-other, none.

### **[VERIFY] Authorized Users**

> TBD

Verify that the list of authorized users works for functionality.

### **[VERIFY] Replacing DLLs when updating Abatab**

> TBD

The Abatab framework is modular. Each core component and module are separate C# projects. This allows changes to be made to a specific component of Abatab, without affecting the other components.

This is mainly done via replacing project DLLs when updating Abatab. This has been tested, but I would like to do a few more in-depth tests to verify everything is working as expected.

These tests should be done using the testing branch.

- [ ] Test to make sure that replacing DLL files works as expected.

- [ ] Confirm that we need/don't need other .DLLs (e.g., Roslyn stuff)

### **[VERIFY] All log types are written to the correct folder**

> TBD

TBD

### **[VERIFY] debugMode**

> TBD

Test the following debugMode functionality:

- [ ] Verify "on" / "enabled" is working correctly

### **[VERIFY] Fallback name**

> TBD

Verify that the avatar fallback username works

## Misc functionality

### **Web Server directories** ([GitHub issue](none))

> TBD

There should be three directories on the web server:

1. AbatabWebService - the web service

* Abatab_LIVE
* Abatab_UAT
* Abatab_SBOX

2. AbatabData - data such as Lieutenant stuff, Abatab logs, etc.

3. AbatabPublic - data available to the public.

### **Issue when an environment is refreshed**

> TBD

When an environment is refreshed, the WSDLs come down from LIVE, and need to be recreated in the refreshed environment.

Is there a better way to do this?

### **New images**

> TBD

We have:

* Changelog
* Logo
* Manual Logo
* Release Notes
* Roadmap

We may need:

* Blank
* Flowchart
* Development notes

### **Lowercasing**

> TBD

We are currently lowercasing lots of stuff (e.g., stuff in the Web.config)...should we?

### **Class/method scopes**

> TBD

Make sure all scopes are correct
