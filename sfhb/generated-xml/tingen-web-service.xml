                <b>About the Tingen Web Service</b><br/>
                Netsmart's Avatar™ is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that<br/>
                leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.<br/>
                <br/>
                While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™<br/>
                functionality via Netsmart's Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other<br/>
                Avatar™ users.<br/>
                <br/>
                Tingen is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't<br/>
                included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality<br/>
                quickly and efficiently.

                        There is a special "AdminMode" that can be set in the Web.Config file, but this is only for administrative/development
                        tasks. Additional information about this mode can be found in the Tingen Web Service Manual.
